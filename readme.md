Dogars
=======

**Note**: The front end code was removed from this repo, entirely rewritten and moved to [dogars-frontend](https://github.com/shoedrip-unbound/dogars-frontend). Some features were completely removed and may not come back.

Install with ```npm install```. Build with gulp. Edit the service file to use your path if you use 
systemd.

Edit ```settings.json``` as you see fit. There's supposed to be a table named ```Sets``` in your database.
You could infer the proper schema from the code, or get a database dump from dogars.ml.

Currently, the application runs on dogars.ml on port 1234 and an nginx rule redirects traffic from port 80 to port 1234.

Works on my machineÂ©.

Features
========

- Automatic hijacker to automatically dump a disconnected, unregistered opponents team on the chat and forfeit the battle

- Manage statistics about champ (win, losses, ELO, avatar)
- Automatically saves replays of battles won by a champ, and links replays to sets it has seen in the battle

- Imported sets validity check

Known bugs
==========

- After a while, Showdown automatically closes the connection if it has
  not been used to transmit data, and a lot of the features rely on
  this.

- Database backup every hour, and preserves every previous backups, just in case.
